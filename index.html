            <p>Chennai: At 3:30 Am on January 28, the merchant tanker BW Maple, carrying tktkt of liquefied petroleum gas from the Las Raffen gas fields of Qatar, eased past the breakwaters of the Kamaraj Port on India’s eastern coast, picking up speed as it headed out into the open waters of the Bay of Bengal. </p>
        <p>The sea was calm, the wind minimal, the temperature was an easy 24 degrees. The Maple, manned by an Indian captain Vinod Sahadevan and a mixed Indian and Filipino crew, was headed further up the coast to Vishakhapatnam.
        </p><p>
        The previous weekend, it had berthed at Kamaraj, a busy port near Chennai, that handles vessels loaded with the primary elements that power India’s economy: gas, oil, iron-ore, coal. 
        </p><p>
        At sea beyond the harbour, another tanker, the MT Dawn Kanchipuram, laden with TKTK of petroleum lubricant, had slowed down as it approached the habour “channel” - a 250 metre wide 16 metre deep passage carved into the sea-bed to allow ships like the Maple and Kanchipuram to enter the port without running aground. 
        </p><p>
        The Maple was in the channel as well, and at 3:38 Am, it was traveling at 10.2 knots (about 19 km/hr) when it slowed, and veered off course. Real-time data from Kamaraj Port’s Vessel Traffic Management System (VTMS) shows the habour-bound Kanchipuram turned as well, suggesting the two massive ships had suddenly realised they were headed for a collision. 
        </p><p>
        Now, as the minutes ticked down, both vessels took desperate, but un-coordinated, evasive action, sliding inexorably closer even as they tried to get out of each other’s way.
         </p><p>
        At 3:45 am the Maple crashed prow-first into the side of the Kanchipuram. 
        </p><p>
        “I saw the two ships collide,” said (?) Arikam, a young fisherman who was out on his boat that morning, “Oil gushed into the sea like blood from a wound.”
        </p><p>
        When dawn broke at a little after six, the sky was abuzz with coastguard helicopters, the port swarmed with tugs and patrol boats. Three kilometres from the coast floated the Kanchipuram - engines immobilized - leaking dark waxy bunker oil into the swirling waters.
        </p><p>
        Later in the day, as the currents carried the oil to beaches all along Tamil Nadu’s eastern coast, Kamaraj Port Ltd issued a statement that would symbolize the company’s response to the calamity.
        </p><p>
        “There is no damage to the environment like oil pollution,” read the six-sentence statement, “All top officials of port closely monitoring and the situation is under control.”

            <h2>Once a lifeline, now a ‘dead river’</h2>
            <p>Official records say that 151 of the 400 villages on the banks of the river, including Begrajpur, have reported ailments like cancer, neurological and digestive disorders and skin and respiratory infection due to the contaminated water.</p>
<p>Abdul Qadir Ansari, 88, has been witness to the ‘slow death’ of the river that passes through his village back yard. The deterioration, he says, started in the 1980s when factories started coming up in the area. Until then, he recalls, the villagers would drink from it.</p>
<p>“Jitna khana nahi khate, us se dugna yahan log dawaiyan khate hain (People here consume more medicines than food).” he adds.</p>
<p>Also known as Harnandi, the rain-fed Hindon originates in the lower Himalayas of neighbouring Uttarakhand. Joined by its two tributaries -- Kali and Krishni – it flows through seven western UP districts before confluence with the Yamuna in Gautam Buddha Nagar.</p>
 
<p>The pollution levels here have earned it a 'dead river' status and its water declared ‘unfit’ even for bathing, according to the Central Pollution Control Board report of 2015.</p>
<div class = "blockquote">
  <p class = "quote">“</p>
  <p>From being a lifeline, the river is now reduced to a carrier of industry waste.</p>
</div>
<p>“It is now a poison-laden drain that has contaminated the water table that feeds the hand pumps, bore wells and tube wells,” says river activist Krishan Pal.</p>
<p>At Baleni village in Baghpat, where the ancient Balmiki Ashram stands on its bank, the water, after Krishni and Kali tributaries merge with it, is plentiful, but foul-smelling.</p>
<p>“Rivers don’t bring votes,” says Lakhsdevanji Maharaj, the head priest of the ashram.  </p>
<p>Raman Tyagi, of the Natural Environmental Education and Research (NEER) Foundation, agrees, “From being a lifeline, the river is now reduced to a carrier of industry waste.”</p>

<h2>Political Inertia</h2>
<p>As political parties kickstart their 2017 campaign, some villages have decided to boycott the polls and polio immunisation drives to mount pressure on the government. </p>
<p>“We will not vote unless something concrete is done,” says Ram Kumar, 42, a farmer of Kinoni village in Saharanpur.</p>
<p>Nudged by civil society, the state government was forced to wake up last year. Following an initiative by waterman Rajendra Singh, chief minister Akhilesh Yadav launched an awareness yatra for Hindon.</p>
<p>Also, a working group led by planning commission member Prof Sudhir Panwar, set up to study the river, visited the region. The government allocated Rs 2 Crore from the budget for preliminary action plan.</p>
<p>“The rural development department is allocating funds to provide clean drinking water in the villages by installing overhead tanks as per NGT directions,” says Prof Panwar.</p>
<p>But all this will take at least 10 years. The activists are not impressed. “The government only makes announcements,” says activist Pal who was part of the yatra.</p></section>

<p>BJP parliamentarians Raghav Lakhanpal (Saharanpur) and Sanjeev Balyan (Muzaffarnagar) are planning a march along the banks. Balyan is Minister of State for Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation.</p>
<p>“The river has no continuous flow of water due to which the waste that is dumped into it doesn’t get washed away. It’s not possible to rejuvenate it overnight,” says Lakhanpal, citing huge costs (Rs 500 crore) required for setting up the proposed sewage treatment plant in Saharanpur.</p>
<p>The pollution level has even alarmed the National Green Tribunal (NGT), which on October 6 directed Ghaziabad civic agencies to submit an action plan within a week for scientific disposal of solid waste in the city.</p>
<p>The industry says it needs time to come up with a solution.</p>
<p>“We have promised to make the industries zero-discharge by March 31, 2017,” says Pankaj Aggarwal, industrialist and chairman of the Muzaffarnagar Municipal Board.</p>
<p>Given the all-round alarm for saving the holy Ganga and Yamuna rivers from pollution, the smaller Hindon can only hope that some help would also flow its way.</p>
